# Jupyter for Programmers

* Monday 22 January 2018

* Location: XFEL HeadQuarters, E2.096

## 14:00 Seminar

[Thomas Kluyver](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/tk2e15/) from the
Jupyter team will give an overview of the Jupyter Notebook
architecture and capabilities, tailored for programmers. This session for
people already comfortable with using Jupyter will cover a range of
extension points which you can use to integrate your own code and systems
with Jupyter.

If you want an introduction to the Jupyter Notebook, you should instead attend the
[workshop the following day](https://github.com/European-XFEL/events/tree/master/2018-01-23)
at DESY.


## 15:00 Hands-on activity 15:00 onwards (optional)

For those interested, a second part of the event is to explore
together one particular topic of showing a "live scene" in the
notebook that updates automatically when the data displayed in the
scene changes.

For this, please bring laptops and potential use cases and we can use
the time flexibly to explore these.

## If you want to attend ...

Please inform hans.fangohr at xfel.eu so we can monitor total numbers.

Thank you!

## Installation of Jupyter Notebook (only for session at 15:00)

* Use Python 3.x

  [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) if you're new to Python, but
