# Jupyter Notebook session (10:00-13:00)

23 January 2018, 10:00 - 13:00

## Target audience

This morning session will not be of interest to every participant of
this satellite workshop on Karabo and data analysis:

This session introduces the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org),
not assuming any prior knowledge.  The Jupyter Notebook (with Python)
can be used to analyse data obtained at XFEL, but it is not the only
option. This morning session will only introduce the Jupyter Notebook
(with no XFEL-specific information). We would expect that this is of
interest to people who consider using the Notebook, in particular if
they like writing code in Python. There is no assumption of prior
knowledge of the notebook (although we assume some generic programming
knowledge).

You can [try the jupyter notebook in your browser](http://try.jupyter.org).


## Requirements

1. Please register your interest to attend the morning session at
   DOODLE POLL. We have only 40 spaces available for this hands-on
   part of the workshop.

2. We ask participants to install the Anaconda Python distribution
   *in advance* of the workshop. See [Installation](#installation) below.

## Workshop format

Presentation will alternate with hands-on exercises; helpers will be
available to help participants with the practical exercises.


## Installation

* Use Python 3.x
* Jupyter, including the Notebook and IPython. It should be available
  through the usual distribution channels, such as [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

  If you have trouble installing Anaconda,
  [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) may
  help.
