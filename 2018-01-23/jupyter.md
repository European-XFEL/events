# Jupyter Notebook session (10:00-13:00)

23 January 2018, 10:00 - 13:00

## Target audience

This morning session will not be of interest to every participant of
this satellite workshop on Karabo and data analysis:

This session introduces the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org),
not assuming any prior knowledge.  The Jupyter Notebook (with Python)
can be used to analyse data obtained at XFEL, but it is not the only
option. This morning session will only introduce the Jupyter Notebook
(with no XFEL-specific information). We would expect that this is of
interest to people who consider using the Notebook, in particular if
they like writing code in Python. There is no assumption of prior
knowledge of the notebook (although we assume some generic programming
knowledge).

You can [try the jupyter notebook in your browser](http://try.jupyter.org).


## Requirements

1. Please register your interest to attend the morning session by
   adding your name to this [Doodle
   poll](https://doodle.com/poll/riv5bhat7qk6fyrq). We have only 40
   spaces available for this hands-on part of the workshop, and if
   demand is greater, we will allocate them in the order of the sign
   up in the doodle poll.

2. We ask participants to install the Anaconda Python distribution
   *in advance* of the workshop. See [Installation](#installation) below.


## Workshop content (draft)

- Notebook interface: code cells & markdown cells
- IPython - beyond plain Python
- Rich display system
- Interactive widgets in notebook output
- Notebook files and nbconvert
- Sharing notebooks with Github, Nbviewer and Binder

## Workshop format

Presentation will alternate with hands-on exercises; helpers will be
available to help participants with the practical exercises.


## Installation

* Use Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook and IPython. We recommend installing
  [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) if you're new to Python, but
  there are other options for experienced Python users; see [Jupyter's install
  page](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

  If you have trouble installing Anaconda,
  [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) may
  help.
