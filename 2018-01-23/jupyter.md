# Jupyter Notebook session (10:00-13:00)

23 January 2018, 10:00 - 13:00

Delivered by Thomas Kluyver from the Jupyter Developer Team

## Target audience

This morning session will not be of interest to every participant of
[the satellite workshop on Karabo and data analysis](Readme.md):

This session introduces the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org),
not assuming any prior knowledge.  The Jupyter Notebook (with Python)
can be used to analyse data obtained at XFEL, but it is not the only
option. This morning session will only introduce the Jupyter Notebook
(with no XFEL-specific information). We would expect that this is of
interest to people who consider using the Notebook, in particular if
they like writing code in Python. There is no assumption of prior
knowledge of the notebook (although we assume some generic programming
knowledge).


## Requirements for attendance

### 1. Register via Doodle poll

Please register your interest to attend the morning session by
adding your name (and ideally your email address to make it easier
for us to contact you) to this [Doodle
poll](https://doodle.com/poll/riv5bhat7qk6fyrq). Only you and Hans
Fangohr will be able to see the data.

We have only 40 spaces available for this hands-on part of the
workshop, and if demand is greater, we will allocate the 40 places
in the order of the sign up in the doodle poll.

Please complete this sign up by Thursday 18 January.

### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook software on your laptop

We ask participants to install the Anaconda Python distribution
*in advance* of the workshop on the laptop they intend to bring to 
the session. See [Installation](#installation) below.

## Workshop content 

- Notebook interface: code cells & markdown cells
- IPython - beyond plain Python
- Rich display system
- Interactive widgets in notebook output
- Notebook files and nbconvert
- Sharing notebooks with Github, Nbviewer and Binder

## Workshop format

Presentation will alternate with hands-on exercises; helpers will be
available to help participants with the practical exercises.


## Installation

* Use Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook and IPython. We recommend installing
  [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) if you're new to Python, but
  there are other options for experienced Python users; see [Jupyter's install
  page](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

  If you have trouble installing Anaconda,
  [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) may
  help.
