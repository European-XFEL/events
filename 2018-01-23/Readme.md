# Satellite workshop on Data Analysis and Karabo (10:00-17:00), DRAFT

Tuesday 23 January 2018, at DESY, FLASH Seminar room (building 28c)

The event is part of
the
[2018 XFEL user meeting](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/18831/)


The data analysis workshop is split into two parts, which can be
attended independently (or both together):

## Morning session: Introduction to Jupyter Notebook (10:00-13:00)

The morning session offers a hands-on workshop introducing
the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) for which we invite
participants to bring laptops. This is suitable for those with some
programming experience, and assumes no prior knowledge of the Jupyter
Notebook. See [here for details](jupyter.md).

## Lunch (13:00 - 14:00)

## Afternoon session: Karabo and Data Analysis at XFEL (14:00-17:00)

The afternoon session provides an overview of Karabo, experiment
control, and online and offline data analysis provision at European
XFEL.
